        <p>You are the captain of a spaceship named "The Flying Hippo." One day, you're working on tuning up your ship's engines when you get an urgent message on your space phone:</p>
        <p>"Captain, one of our Mars robots is sick. We need you to go to Mars immediately and retrieve it so that we can fix it and download the results of its important experiments."</p>
        <p>You remember that you're supposed to go to a meeting of the Space Scouts tonight, and you were really looking forward to it. But, on the other hand, the other Space Scouts would understand that this mission is very important.</p>
        <p>What do you do? Go to Mars, or stay home?</p>

        <p>Great choice! Mars is lovely this time of year (or, during the time of the year when you'll arrive, about 260 days from now!).</p>
        <p>You pack up your things and prepare enough food for the journey, then take off!</p>
        <p>Launch goes smoothly and you sit back, put on your headphones, and prepare for a relaxing trip.</p>
        <p>A week later, things are going great. There's nothing for you to do except read, listen to music, and watch movies. Just then, you hear a strange sound.</p>
        <p>"meow."</p>
        <p>It sounds like Gizmo, your cat! She must have snuck aboard while you were packing!</p>
        <p>You're happy to have the company, but you didn't pack enough food for the both of you, and there certainly isn't a grocery store on the way to Mars.</p>
        <p>You have a choice: risk running out of food on the return trip, or turn around now and go home. What will you do?</p>
    </div>
    <div class="storyPart" id="answer12">
        <p>You decide to stay home. They'll get someone else to fly to Mars. Besides, you heard that they're going to have free pizza at the Space Scouts meeting!</p>
    </div>
    <div class="storyPart" id="err1">
        <p>Please answer Mars or Earth.</p>
    </div>
    <div class="storyPart" id="answer21">
        <p>You decide to risk it. The journey is long, and you give sweet Gizmo half your food, knowing that you may not survive the return trip, but the Flying Hippo can carry the robot home without you, and at least the important experimental data (and
            Gizmo, of course) will be safe.</p>
        <p>When you arrive at Mars, you quickly locate the sick robot. But, you also discover something else: a large ice chest full of delicious sandwiches! The last repair crew to visit the robot must have left this here! You unwrap one of the sandwiches
            and carefully take a bite. Peanut butter! Your favorite! Gizmo's favorite too!</p>
        <p>You pack up the sandwiches and the sick robot and begin the trip home, knowing that there's now more than enough food for both you and Gizmo.</p>
        <p>The sick robot gets sicker on the way home and spills sticky oil from its lower backside, it spills about 2 meters away from you. It stinks terribly. </p>
        <p>You have a choice, leave the joystick and clean it up or hold your breath all the way home? </p>
    </div>
    <div class="storyPart" id="answer22">
        <p>Let someone else get the robot. You turn the Flying Hippo around and head home.</p>
        <p>When you get back to the spaceport, you open the door to exit your spaceship and your boss is standing outside.</p>
        <p>You apologize and explain the whole thing to him about how there wouldn't have been enough food.</p>
        <p>Steam comes out of your boss's mechanical head as he tells you that there are always plenty of sandwiches on Mars, and that you would have been just fine if you had completed your mission. He fires you. You pick up Gizmo and start walking home.</p>
        <p>Oh well, at least you still have Gizmo!</p>

    <div class="storyPart" id="answer30">
        <p>You decide to leave the joystick and clean up. Your spaceship spins out of control. As you fall backwards you land on the spill with the dishcloth you had in your hand. Suddenly the ship hits the atmostpher, you fall forward back into your seat
            and your foot hits the auto pilot button. You pull a 360 and stabilizes the spaceship. You hear on the over the radio the raor of amazement and the clapping of hands.</p>
        <p>you look at Gizmo in surprise and all he does is lift his finger to his mouth, mouthing "shhhhh".</p>
        <p>When you return home, you get the welcome of a hero and you are promoted to Flight instructor, you live a cushioned life for the rest of your life, and show off your "secret" skill of hitting the auotpilot button at airshows. You become a legend.</p>
    </div>
    <div class="storyPart" id="answer31">
        <p>You decided to hold your breath. Next thing you get dizzy, the ship starts spinning out of control. You pass out.</p>
        <p>Next thing you wake up and there is just enough time to eject and save yourself and one other being. You choose Gizmo and eject with him. You were picked up by emergency services and you are know as the guy who made it all the way home, with saving
            a robot and then chose to let it die. You cost the goverment billions in tax payer money. No one likes you.
            <p>Oh well, at least you still have Gizmo!</p>
